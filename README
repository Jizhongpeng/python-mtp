About
-----

python-mtp is a wrapper for libmtp, allowing python applications to
communicate with MTP devices that are supported by libmtp. For supported &
tested devices see there. It is implemented using cython.

Simple test scripts can be found in examples/ for all major operations.

Major Pitfalls
--------------

libmtp has a big drawback that is a cache filled at startup. This takes alot of
time due to usb communication. Depending on the number of files it takes a
minute or more. A flag was given to the MediaTransfer-class construtor that
allows creating a connection without caching. This renders some functions
unusual, others require this mode.

On Andriod devices MTP sometimes doesn't not work if USB-debugging is enabled.

If the scrennlock is active MTP is known not to work well on some devices.

Some devices have problems if you wait too long with the connect after plugging
in.

While libmtp provides errorcodes some functions just return -1 (which is not a
listed error). Other functions return a pointer and have no way to determine
the cause of the error (they just return NULL).

Setting the debugging level is of some help.
